# Assessment submission

## Task Overview
Your task is to build a small application that demonstrates your ability to:
- Scrape and analyze website markup.

- Identify authentication components in web pages.

- Handle input dynamically and return structured results.


## If you would like to run a cloned version of the app

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
